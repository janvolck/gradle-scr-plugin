gradle-scr-plugin
=================
Everyone must recognize its superiors (and this project was dead for a while now ...)

For my latest projects I've switched to gradle-bundle-plugin, which does all I need (and more): https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.dm.bundle. If you're still using gradle-scr-plugin or a fork of it, I'd advice also to switch to gralde-bundle-plugin.

A personal usage of this plugin can be found at : https://github.com/janvolck/kestro-io
